# CPSC_355 Assignment 2
#### An application written in ARM Assembly that returns the lowest and highest frequency words in a document, 10/10/2020
#### By **Jeremy Kimotho**
## Description
The application prompts the user for an integer between 5 and 20  inclusive and returns a document of X size (where X is the integer you entered) with the number of times a word appeared. The document size is then printed (which is the sum of all words) and the highest and lowest frequency as a percentage value (where frequency is number of times a word appeared, multiplied by 100 and the output of that divided by document size).
## Setup/Installation Requirements

**On an ARM server (assign2b.asm)**
